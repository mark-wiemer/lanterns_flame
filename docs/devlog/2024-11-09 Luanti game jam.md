- Update game.conf title and remove some devtest mods
- Work on worldgen, having issues with holes in the map, general dev workflow
  - Wuzzy probably manually added holes with the "air" and "ignore" checks, but I'm not sure how to undo them
  - cannot edit world bounds, some chunks within bounds don't seem to appear
  - 8ae0b16 Mark Wiemer diagnostic world edge pillars mostly working but one corner missing, some holes still present
