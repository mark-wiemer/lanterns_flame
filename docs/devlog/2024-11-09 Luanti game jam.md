- Update game.conf title and remove some devtest mods
- Work on worldgen, having issues with holes in the map, general dev workflow
  - Wuzzy probably manually added holes with the "air" and "ignore" checks, but I'm not sure how to undo them
  - cannot edit world bounds, some chunks within bounds don't seem to appear
  - 8ae0b16 Mark Wiemer diagnostic world edge pillars mostly working but one corner missing, some holes still present
  - 9bc6045 Mark Wiemer Revert "Update worldgen bounds" entirely working!
  - 41f45b8 Mark Wiemer Should be fully flat world also works :)
