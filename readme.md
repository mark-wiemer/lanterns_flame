# Lantern's Flame

Forge your own path through a world full of rich quests and mysterious lands. Live as a freelancing recluse, only visiting town to collect bounties. Join a village and help it grow into an empire. Wander the lands in search of ancient relics and answers to age-old questions. Every step of the way, you're in charge of what you do next.

## Genesis

Hi, Mark here. Lantern's Flame: Genesis is an extremely early pre-alpha demo started during [Luanti Game Jam 2024](https://jam.luanti.org/). It's a showcase of the core systems I plan to add to Lantern's Flame. It's only published to get me over that hump of "just doing something." As a demo, it features minimal content and is not meant to serve as a full game. As such, the sandbox element will be mostly missing! After publication, I plan to release improvements as I learn new systems: audio, animation, modeling, etc. However, Genesis will remain a demo-like experience for its entirety, giving players a taste of what's to come in the full release of Lantern's Flame!

## Installation

As of this writing, Lantern's Flame isn't published to ContentDB. However, I plan to publish it by the end of December 2024! 🤞 For now:

1. Install Luanti
1. Open your `path/to/luanti/games` folder
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/mark-wiemer/lanterns_flame`

Next time you open Luanti, Lantern's Flame should be available to play!

## Notes

Lantern's Flame is made in [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) (formerly known as Minetest). The base game is [Wuzzy's Tutorial](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/tutorial/).
